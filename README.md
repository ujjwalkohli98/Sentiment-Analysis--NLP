The BBC Article dataset has been picked up from Kaggle and has been worked upon for Sentiment analysis. Starting from the data preprocessing, 
we have proceeded to analysing the sentiment of each article using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) tool provided in the NLTK library.
After this, a Machine learning classification model has been built on it with this sentiment as the target variable and the article description as the input feature.
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer has been used to convert the text to a machine-readable format (Sparse matrix).
